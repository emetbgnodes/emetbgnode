Almost 30 years have passed since Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta introduced that practical solution in the world to make a series of digital documents unmodifiable, and that a decade later it would bear the first cryptocurrencies

Since then, many events have occurred around this technological development that, strangely, have not had the impact on relevance compared to other forms of technology (social networks) around the Internet.

This is explained, among other circumstances, because this computationally intelligent resource, eliminated from the outset the intermediaries who throughout the history of humanity had managed to profit through their services.

The emergence of this model of exchange of properties, information and wealth has meant rethinking all the archetypes of relations around the economy, and therefore social models.

EmetBG makes its appearance and as part of this evolutionary process that has been brewing naturally in the last five years, which aims to achieve a better use of the blockchain at the level of service coverage, underpinned by a series of novel benefits, which until at the moment the market has failed to combine efficiently.

What does EmetBG offer?

This ultra-secure ecosystem gives the user the possibility to enjoy all the security environments of a blockchain, designed so that usability is based on mixed service experiences in different areas.

This unique model in the market is one more step of the evolution of the blockchain, which on the one hand maintains decentralization and on the other, effectively links a platform to solve the daily life of cryptotenients.

EmetBG has an advanced audit and tested by a specialized team, supported by a system of encrypted and traceable transactions that only the owner can access.

This system has double encryption, which allows users from a private key to generate private keys in which computational force and the application of the Hash function.

The EmetBG blockchain enables the execution of smart contracts, without any possibility of inactivity, censorship, fraud or third party interference. It allows developers to create markets, store records of debts or promises of commitments, and the actions required by a user who is looking to decentralize their business activities.

The EmetBG blockchain also houses a cryptocurrency that supports KYC (Know Your Customer), a protocol that allows you to verify the security of your customers' transactions, at a speed of 2.400 transactions per minute, chains an ecosystem where cryptocurrency will find applications so robust as Faswet.
